## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. PlagiarismDetection Class
```javascript
class PlagiarismDetection {
    constructor() {
        this.plagiarismData = {};
        this.init();
    }
}
```

#### 2. Data Structure
```javascript
plagiarismData = {
    scannedDocuments: [],
    knownSources: [],
    metrics: {
        totalScanned: 0,
        averageSimilarity: 0,
        plagiarismDetected: 0
    },
    settings: {
        similarityThreshold: 0.7,
        minTextLength: 50
    }
}
```

#### 3. Key Methods
- `scanDocument(text, documentName, author)`: Scans document for plagiarism
- `performScan(text)`: Performs the actual scanning analysis
- `calculateSimilarity(text1, text2)`: Calculates similarity between texts
- `generateRecommendations(similarity, matches)`: Creates improvement suggestions
- `showPlagiarismDashboard()`: Displays scanning interface

### Scanning Process

#### 1. Text Analysis
```javascript
async performScan(text) {
    // Simulate scanning process
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    
    const similarities = [];
    const matches = [];

    // Check against known sources
    this.plagiarismData.knownSources.forEach(source => {
        const similarity = this.calculateSimilarity(text, source.content);
        if (similarity > 0.3) {
            similarities.push(similarity);
            matches.push({
                source: source.title,
                author: source.author,
                similarity: similarity
            });
        }
    });

    return {
        similarity: overallSimilarity,
        matches: matches,
        recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(overallSimilarity, matches)
    };
}
```

#### 2. Similarity Calculation
```javascript
calculateSimilarity(text1, text2) {
    const words1 = text1.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);
    const words2 = text2.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);
    
    const commonWords = words1.filter(word => words2.includes(word));
    const totalWords = new Set([...words1, ...words2]);
    
    return commonWords.length / totalWords.size;
}
```

#### 3. Recommendation Generation
```javascript
generateRecommendations(similarity, matches) {
    const recommendations = [];

    if (similarity > 0.8) {
        recommendations.push('High similarity detected. Consider rewriting significant portions.');
    } else if (similarity > 0.6) {
        recommendations.push('Moderate similarity found. Review and paraphrase matched sections.');
    } else if (similarity > 0.3) {
        recommendations.push('Low similarity detected. Add proper citations where needed.');
    } else {
        recommendations.push('Document appears original. Continue with current approach.');
    }

    return recommendations;
}
```
